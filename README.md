# simple-text-to-speech
A simple single page application for people with restricted fine motor control to generate sentences and have them read out by their web browser

Made (in 1 afternoon) for my close friend and colleague Dr Shaun Phillip Johnstone, 25/2/1988 - 14/12/2019, who sadly passed away before he was able to try this. This repository is left here in his memory.
